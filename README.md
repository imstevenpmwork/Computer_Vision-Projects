# Computer Vision Projects

Projects were developed as a team back in 2019/2020 using MATLAB, but some of them might work using Octave as well.

Each project has:
* The source materials in the Materials folder (images and instructions)
* The MATLAB code developed in the Code folder (.m scripts)
* The report written

To run a project:
* Configure the workspace paths!
* Run the Lab(X).m script from the MATLAB command window
